		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Somali Sambusas are a stuffed pastry which is deep fried. The dough for the pastry is made from wheat flour. It is rolled out into a large circle then cut down the middle into 4 pieces. Each piece is folded into a cone, and while sitting in the palm of the hand, filled. The top part of the cone is folded down giving the sambusa its signature traingle shape. While sambusa can be filled with vegetables, the most popular type is filled with meat. Sambusa is similar to the indian snack Samosa. It is a very popular appetizer served not only during Ramadan, but any on occasion as an appetizer.</p>
