		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Canjeero(Anjera) is the most common breakfast food in Somaliaand Somalians typically eat around 3 or 4 for breakfast, often accompanied by a cup of tea. It is commonly served drizzled with butter or ghee and sugar. It is also accompanied by a curry, meat stew(maraq), soup, or liver and onions. In Somalia they will cook the pancake on a tava which is  circular, disc stove used frequently just for cooking canjeero(Anjera). However, since most Westerners are unlikely to have a tava lying around, a conventional pan will suffice for making this recipe.</p>
